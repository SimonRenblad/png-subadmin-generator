How to use

First visit the geoBoundaries website to find country code and administrative level. In this example we use India admin level 1:

IND
ADM1

1. Create folder "IND_ADM1"
2. Run the following in the command line:
python script.py IND ADM1


If error occurs, make sure all dependencies are installed with pip.
